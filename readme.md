Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Google Sites

Employee Details
	• Employee ID - should be tracking number
	• Employee Type
	• Title
	• Manager's Email
	• Department
	• Cost Center



## Authentication
Changed AuthenticatesUsers.php file to use clock_number instead of email for login (line 141)

	member number should exclude: 1234, 4 numbers all the same (1111, 2222, etc.), 2580, birthyear (1950 - 2000), couplets (7878, 8181, etc)


## Members
	• when *member status* changes, either integrate functionality to update Google Sites directly or send an email to specific committees to be notified
			***are there other fields that should also function this way?***

## Coaches
	• will want to see everyone they coach and who has attended practices, met requirements and any oustanding warnings or LOAs
